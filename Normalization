1. First Normal Form (1NF):
•	Each column contains atomic values: There are no repeating groups or arrays in any table. For example, patient details are stored in separate columns.
•	All entries in columns are of the same type: No mixed data types exist in any column.
The hospital database is in 1NF.


2. Second Normal Form (2NF):
•	It is already in 1NF: As explained above, the database is in 1NF.
•	No partial dependency: Each table has a primary key, and all non-key attributes depend fully on the primary key. There are no composite keys, so partial dependency doesn't apply here.
The hospital database is in 2NF.


3. Third Normal Form (3NF):
•	It is in 2NF: We already established that the database is in 2NF.
•	No transitive dependency: There are no attributes in any table that depend on non-primary key columns. For example, in the Patients table, columns like Name and ContactInfo depend only on PatientID. Similarly, all other tables follow this rule.
The hospital database is in 3NF.


Conclusion
The hospital database is in Third Normal Form (3NF). It is well-structured, with no partial or transitive dependencies, ensuring minimal redundancy and maintaining data integrity.
